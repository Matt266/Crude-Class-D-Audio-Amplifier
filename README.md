# Crude-Class-D-Audio-Amplifier

## General
  The purpose of the Project was to build a functional circuit without microcontroller and advanced ICs in order
  to pracitce simulation and design of circuits.
  As an old Audio-Amplifier stopped working I decided to try to make a new Amplifier for the Subwoofer it powered.
  
  I had not yet started studying electrical engineering at an unviersity when I did this project - it is 100 percent
  based on web researching! With simulating the circuit in LTSpice it was possible for me to build a working concept though.
  So don't expect perfect descisions - I researched for the most optimal design I could find and realisticaly implement.
  
  I restrcited myself further by only allowing components I had laying around at home. This means the component choice 
  is suboptimal and could be improved by using more suitable components (e.g. MOSFETs with lower on resistance).
  So for simulating the circuit I downloaded the corresponding models or used components with similiar charackteristics.
