# Crude-Class-D-Audio-Amplifier

## General
  The purpose of the Project was to build a functional circuit without microcontroller and advanced ICs in order
  to pracitce simulation and design of circuits.
  As an old Audio-Amplifier stopped working I decided to try to make a new Amplifier for the Subwoofer it powered.
  
  I had not yet started studying electrical engineering at an unviersity when I did this project - it is 100 percent
  based on web researching! With simulating the circuit in LTSpice it was possible for me to build a working concept though.
  So don't expect perfect descisions - I researched for the most optimal design I could find and realisticaly implement.
  
  I restrcited myself further by only allowing components I had laying around at home. This means the component choice 
  is suboptimal and could be improved by using more suitable components (e.g. MOSFETs with lower on resistance).
  So for simulating the circuit I downloaded the corresponding models or used components with similiar charackteristics.

## Choosing an amplifier topology
  For the basic ampflifier conecept there are a few topoligies to choose from.
  * Class-A which would have been a single-resistor amplifier in my case
  * Class-B which basically would split the audio signal into a positive and negative phase and amplify those with different amplifiers
  * Class-C same as Class-B but splitting the signal into more than two "sections"
  * Class-D convert the unamplified analog audio to a digital signal which can be amplfified a lot easier and filtering it back to an analog signal

  I found the Class-D amp to be the most suitable design. First of all it is the most energy efficient topology. There is no "standby current"
  as in a Class-A design where the amplifiying transistor is partly turned on (this is because DC-biasing is needed for a single transistor to allow 
  it to amplifiy the complete fullwave in the linear region and without clipping). Also the amplification of the digital Signals itself is much more 
  efficient than an analog amplification. And at last I don't have to fine tune DC-biasing and component values in order to fight crossover distortion which 
  is a present problem in Class-B and C amplifiers. Calculating a good Class A, B or C design would have been beyond my possiblities at this time and 
  as just copying values from internet resources would have violated the restrictions I gave myself. The Class-D design was a clear topoligy choice.
  
## Concept
  The basic concept of the Class-D design I chose is rather simple:
  1. The analog audio is filtered and converted to a pwm signal with changing duty cycle (this might sound like a complex conversion but really is easy to do)
  2. then the digital pwm signal is amplified through the output stage
  3. the high frequency pwm signal still contains the low frequency information which therefore can be extracted by lowpassing the output signal

## Design choices
  Now that I had an Idea of the functional blocks that I had to implement I started to research for the best ways to implement those blocks.
  
### Filters
  First things first I omitted the filters. The input filter would be needed to protect for any noise - as my input signal is rather clear and I epexted my design
  to introduce a lot of distortion due to the unsuited components available and my lack in experience and knowledge. The ouput filter will filter out the high
  frequency content of the pwm signal - as this frequency is way to high to be heard with 200kHz (I didn't have chosen a fixed frequency yet but knew it would be
  at least that high) I omitted this filter too. There are other reasons for applying the lowpass like avoid possible damage to the speakers, EMI, etc. which I
  also ignored for this project.
